# 🏢 Company Settings

The Company Settings module allows the system admin to set and update primary information related to the company:

* Company Name and Display Name
* Branch (Head Office or Other)
* Email ID and Phone Number
* Country, State, Postal Code
* Primary and Secondary Addresses
* Company Logo
* Active/Inactive Status

This section ensures the company’s identity is properly mapped across all modules and appears in reports and exports for standardization and branding.
