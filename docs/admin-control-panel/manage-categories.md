# 🗂️ Manage Categories

The **Manage Categories** section allows administrators to define and organize all asset classifications within the system. By creating a two-level structure—**Main Categories** and **Sub Categories**—users can ensure assets are grouped logically for better tracking, easier reporting, and faster identification across departments. This modular classification supports scalability and consistent data entry across the organization.

#### 🔹 Main Categories

Main Categories are the top-level classification for grouping similar types of assets—like Furniture, IT Equipment, or Office Supplies.

**Features:**

* **Add New Category**: Assign a unique Code, Name, and optional Description.
* **Status Management**: Mark categories as Active or Inactive based on usage.
* **Edit/Delete**: Update or remove categories as needed.

**📸 Screens Shown:**

* **Main Category List View**: Quickly view all categories with Code, Name, Status, and Action buttons (Edit/Delete).
* **Create Main Category**: Input fields for Code, Name, Description, and Status.

#### 🔸 Sub Categories

Each Main Category can have multiple Sub Categories for more granular grouping (e.g., under "Furniture" you can have “Chairs,” “Desks,” “Storage Units”).

**Features:**

* **Add New Sub Category**: Assign a Code, Name, Description, and link to a parent Main Category.
* **Quick List View**: View all Sub Categories including their Main Category linkage.
* **Edit/Delete**: Update subcategories or remove outdated ones.

**📸 Screens Shown:**

* **Sub Category List View**: Displays Code, Name, Status, and management actions.
* **Create Sub Category**: Select a Main Category, define Sub Category details, and choose status.
