# 📦 Manage Assets

In this module, users manage asset records grouped under what are called "Asset Masters." Each Asset Master refers to a general item category (e.g., Dining Chair), while multiple individual assets (tagged and tracked) are managed under it.

***

#### 🗂️ Asset Master List

The Asset Master List gives a summarized view of all asset groups and their current status:

* **Name**: Asset Master name (e.g., Dining Chair)
* **Location**: Default assigned location
* **Total Asset**: Number of individual assets under this master
* **Available / Not Available**: Live count of active assets
* **Maintenance / Others**: Assets under maintenance or other statuses
* **Actions**:
  * 👁️ View Assets: To list all individual assets under this master
  * ➕ Add Asset: Add individual assets
  * 🖊️ Edit: Edit Asset Master details
  * 🗑️ Delete: Remove the Asset Master (only if no dependent records)

#### ➕ Add Asset Master

When you click **+ Add Asset Master**, you’ll be taken to the creation screen where you fill the following:

* **Asset Description**
* **Asset Image**
* **Financial Year**
* **Accumulated Depreciation Cost** (per year)

Once saved, the Asset Master is listed in the main view and individual assets can be added.
