  This module helps Admins manage all asset locations within the organization.

  assets are tagged and audited.

# 📍 Manage Locations

#### 🎯 Purpose

The Locations module is essential to structure and map asset inventory against physical zones. Every asset in the system is tied to a specific location for tracking, auditing, and reporting.

***

#### 🧭 What You Can Do

**1. View All Locations**

The **Locations / List** page displays:

* ✅ Location Code and Name
* 📦 Total Assets in each location
* ✅ Asset status counts (Available, Not Available, Maintenance, Others)
* 🟢 Status (Active/Inactive)
* ⚙️ Actions (View Details, Edit, Delete)

Admins can also **filter** locations by name and status for easy access.

**2. Add a New Location**

From the **+ Add Location** button:

* Enter a unique **Code** (used as an identifier)
* Provide a **Name** (e.g., "16A-Event Area")
* Set the **Status** (Active/Inactive)
* Click **Save**

Once saved, the location is added to the system and ready to be used during asset tagging or auditing.

**3. Edit or Delete**

From the Actions panel:

* ✏️ **Edit** to modify location name, code, or status
* 🗑️ **Delete** to remove a location (if no assets are tagged under it)

***

**4. View Location Details**

Clicking the 🔍 **Info Icon** opens the **Asset Detailed View**, showing:

* Location name and creation timestamp
* Breakdown of asset statuses:
  * 🆕 New
  * ✅ Available
  * ❌ Not Available
  * 🔧 Maintenance
  * 🗑 Disposed
  * 💥 Damaged
  * 🚫 Removed
* 📋 List of all assets in the location with:
  * Tag Number

A mini statistics graph provides a visual summary of asset statuses within that location.

> 📌 All future audits, asset assignments, and maintenance activities are tied to these locations. It's crucial to organize them clearly and keep them updated.
