# 📊 Dashboard Overview

#### What is the Dashboard?

The **Dashboard** is the first screen you see after a successful admin login. It gives a quick snapshot of the overall system — offering real-time insights on assets, users, and locations. It helps Admins monitor activities at a glance without needing to navigate deeper into other modules.
