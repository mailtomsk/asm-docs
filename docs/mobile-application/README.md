# Mobile Application

The **Mobile Application** is the primary tool used by on-ground staff or audit personnel to interact with the asset system in real time. Installed on an Android-based handheld RFID scanner device, the app enables users to scan RFID-tagged assets, conduct audits, assign new tags, and update asset statuses â€” all while moving from one location to another.

It is built for speed, accuracy, and ease of use during day-to-day operations.

#### What Users Can Do in the App

Core capabilities include:

* Viewing assets assigned to each **location**
* Scanning RFID tags for **auditing and verification**
* Assigning **new RFID tags** to untagged assets
* Marking assets as **available**, **under maintenance**, or **disposed**
* Submitting audit data to the backend
* Reviewing previous **audit history**

Each feature will be covered in detail in the following sections to help users get the most out of the app in daily use.

> ðŸ“² The app is designed to work seamlessly with the RFID scanner device and syncs all data securely to the backend.
