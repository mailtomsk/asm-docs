# System Components

#### 🔖 RFID Tags

**What are RFID Tags?**\
RFID tags are small labels attached to assets. Each tag has a unique chip that stores the asset’s identity.

**What You Need to Know:**

* Tags are usually **UHF (Ultra High Frequency)** for better scanning range.
* Tags must be securely fixed to the asset's surface.
* The tag ID is linked to the asset in the backend system.

> ✅ Tip: Make sure the tag is readable using the scanner after attaching it to an asset.

#### 🔍 RFID Scanner Device

**What is the Scanner?**\
It’s a **handheld UHF scanner** integrated with a mobile computing unit. It is used to wirelessly detect RFID-tagged assets across rooms, shelves, or storage areas — quickly and accurately, without needing a direct line of sight.

It combines powerful RFID reading capabilities with built-in computing, touch display, and Android OS to work seamlessly with the mobile app.

#### Key Specifications (for User Awareness)

* **RFID Standard**: EPC Gen2v2 / ISO 18000-63
* **Frequency Range**: UHF 865–928 MHz (region-specific tuning)
* **Read Range**: Up to **8–12 meters** for passive RFID tags
* **Antenna**: Circular polarized for 1D/2D omnidirectional reads
* **Read Rate**: >700 tags per second
* **Trigger**: Easy-grip physical scan trigger (ergonomic handle)
* **Operating System**: Android-based mobile unit (pre-installed app)
* **Display**: 5.5” HD+ touchscreen (glove and wet touch supported)
* **Connectivity**: 4G LTE, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 5.1
* **Battery**: Hot-swappable, 5200mAh battery with extended usage support
* **Durability**: IP65/IP67 water and dust resistance

#### How to Use the Scanner

1. **Power On** the device (both scanner and touch display).
2. Open the **installed Mobile App** from the home screen.
3. **Pair or verify** that the app is connected to the RFID scanner module.
4. Select a **location** or audit mode inside the app.
5. **Trigger the scan** by pressing the yellow scan button on the handle.
6. Sweep slowly across the assets in the room — the scanner detects all tags in range.
7. Once scanning is complete, review and sync the results.

#### Best Practices

* ✅ Always charge the device overnight before use.
* ✅ Perform slow, steady sweeps for better tag detection.
* ✅ Use two hands for extended sessions to reduce fatigue.
* ✅ Avoid scanning near metal-heavy environments without stepping back a few feet.
* ✅ Clean the scanner surface with a dry cloth — avoid water or solvents.

> ✅ Tip: Hold the scanner at waist or chest level and sweep slowly for better accuracy.

#### 📱 Mobile App

**What is the App?**\
The **Mobile App** is an Android-based application that works hand-in-hand with the RFID Scanner Device. It allows users and audit staff to **scan RFID-tagged assets**, perform location-wise **audits**, **assign new assets**, and **submit reports** — all from the palm of their hand.

Designed for field use, the app is lightweight, intuitive, and optimized for rugged mobile devices.

With the mobile app, users can:

* 🔍 Scan and verify assets by location
* 🆕 Assign new assets during audits
* 🛠 Mark assets as **Available**, **Maintenance**, or **Disposed**
* 📤 Submit completed audits to the backend
* 🕘 View past audit history

The app syncs all actions to the backend in real time, ensuring centralized data consistency.

> 📌 Each feature is explained in detail in the upcoming Mobile App section.

✅ Tip: Always sync after a scan to avoid data loss.

#### 🖥 Backend Panel

**What is the Backend Panel?**\
The **Backend Panel** is a web-based control system used by Admins and Admin Users to manage the entire asset infrastructure. It offers centralized control for everything — from asset assignment and audits to user management and reporting.

Key features include:

* 📍 Managing Locations
* 🗂 Organizing Asset Categories and Subcategories
* 🏷 Handling Manufacturers, Vendors, and Asset Masters
* 📘 Assigning General Ledgers to Assets
* 👥 Creating and Managing Users with Role-Based Access
* 📈 Viewing and Exporting Reports
* 📊 Accessing a Dashboard with real-time asset status

> 📌 Detailed usage of each section is covered later in the manual.

> ✅ Tip: Use filters to quickly access assets by category, location, or status.
