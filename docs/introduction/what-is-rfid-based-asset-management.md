# What is RFID-Based Asset Management?

#### What is RFID?

**RFID** stands for **Radio Frequency Identification**. It uses small tags (with chips and antennas) that can be scanned wirelessly by a reader. Each tag stores a unique ID for an asset.

Unlike barcodes, **RFID does not require line-of-sight** and can scan multiple tags at once — even through material like metal or plastic.

#### How RFID Improves Asset Management

Here’s what makes RFID ideal for tracking assets:

* 🔍 **Faster Scanning**: Scan dozens of items in seconds.
* 🎯 **More Accurate**: Avoid human errors and mismatches.
* 🏷 **Unique Identity**: Each asset is tagged and traceable.
* 🔁 **Real-Time Sync**: Updates flow directly to the backend system.

Whether you’re managing hospital equipment, office IT assets, or warehouse items, RFID makes it effortless to track what you own and where it is.
